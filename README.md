Welcome to Red Cross Reform! Here are some setup instructions for how to best use the app after opening your emulator:
1. In the window next to your Android Emulator, click on the three dots to open Location settings.
2. Search for and set a location for your emulator while using our app; we recommend your local suburb, to give an impression of your current location as the user.
3. Save the point and set it as your location with the 'Set Location' button. You can now close the settings and open our app!
